Project Documentation
=====================

This project utilizes data from two separate sources, each of which is documented in the following files:

- OEWS Estimates 2022: data_source_documentation_OEWS_Estimates_2022.txt
- County Business Patterns 2021: data_source_documentation_County_Business_Patterns_2021.txt

Important: The datasets for these sources are too large to be included directly in this repository, as their combined size exceeds 25 MB. Therefore, you will need to download them separately. The URLs for downloading the datasets can be found in the respective documentation files:
