4. Datenbeschreibung

    The OEWS program produces employment and wage estimates for over 800 occupations. 
	These are estimates of the number of jobs in certain occupations, and estimates of the wages paid to them. 
	These estimates are available for the nation as a whole, for individual States, and for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), 
	metropolitan divisions, and nonmetropolitan areas; national occupational estimates for specific industries are also available.

		Field                     Field Description
		area                      U.S. (99), state FIPS code, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or New England City and Town Area (NECTA) code, or OEWS-specific nonmetropolitan area code
		area_title                Area name
		area_type                 Area type: 1= U.S.; 2= State; 3= U.S. Territory; 4= Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or New England City and Town Area (NECTA); 6= Nonmetropolitan Area
		prim_state                The primary state for the given area. "US" is used for the national estimates.
		naics                     North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the given industry
		naics_title               North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) title for the given industry
		i_group                   Industry level. Indicates cross-industry or NAICS sector, 3-digit, 4-digit, 5-digit, or 6-digit industry. For industries that OEWS no longer publishes at the 4-digit NAICS level, the “4-digit” designation indicates the most detailed industry breakdown available: either a standard NAICS 3-digit industry or an OEWS-specific combination of 4-digit industries. Industries that OEWS has aggregated to the 3-digit NAICS level (for example, NAICS 327000) will appear twice, once with the “3-digit” and once with the “4-digit” designation.
		own_code                  Ownership type: 1= Federal Government; 2= State Government; 3= Local Government; 123= Federal, State, and Local Government; 235=Private, State, and Local Government; 35 = Private and Local Government; 5= Private; 57=Private, Local Government Gambling Establishments (Sector 71), and Local Government Casino Hotels (Sector 72); 58= Private plus State and Local Government Hospitals; 59= Private and Postal Service; 1235= Federal, State, and Local Government and Private Sector
		occ_code                  The 6-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code or OEWS-specific code for the occupation
		occ_title                 SOC title or OEWS-specific title for the occupation
		o_group                   SOC occupation level. For most occupations, this field indicates the standard SOC major, minor, broad, and detailed levels, in addition to all-occupations totals. For occupations that OEWS no longer publishes at the SOC detailed level, the “detailed” designation indicates the most detailed data available: either a standard SOC broad occupation or an OEWS-specific combination of detailed occupations. Occupations that OEWS has aggregated to the SOC broad occupation level will appear in the file twice, once with the “broad” and once with the “detailed” designation.
		tot_emp                   Estimated total employment rounded to the nearest 10 (excludes self-employed).
		emp_prse                  Percent relative standard error (PRSE) for the employment estimate. PRSE is a measure of sampling error, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding estimate. Sampling error occurs when values for a population are estimated from a sample survey of the population, rather than calculated from data for all members of the population. Estimates with lower PRSEs are typically more precise in the presence of sampling error.
		jobs_1000                 The number of jobs (employment) in the given occupation per 1,000 jobs in the given area. Only available for the state and MSA estimates; otherwise, this column is blank.
		loc_quotient              The location quotient represents the ratio of an occupation’s share of employment in a given area to that occupation’s share of employment in the U.S. as a whole. For example, an occupation that makes up 10 percent of employment in a specific metropolitan area compared with 2 percent of U.S. employment would have a location quotient of 5 for the area in question. Only available for the state, metropolitan area, and nonmetropolitan area estimates; otherwise, this column is blank.
		pct_total                 Percent of industry employment in the given occupation. Percents may not sum to 100 because the totals may include data for occupations that could not be published separately. Only available for the national industry estimates; otherwise, this column is blank.
		pct_rpt                   Percent of establishments reporting the given occupation for the cell. Only available for the national industry estimates; otherwise, this column is blank.
		h_mean                    Mean hourly wage
		a_mean                    Mean annual wage
		mean_prse                 Percent relative standard error (PRSE) for the mean wage estimate. PRSE is a measure of sampling error, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding estimate. Sampling error occurs when values for a population are estimated from a sample survey of the population, rather than calculated from data for all members of the population. Estimates with lower PRSEs are typically more precise in the presence of sampling error.
		h_pct10                   Hourly 10th percentile wage
		h_pct25                   Hourly 25th percentile wage
		h_median                  Hourly median wage (or the 50th percentile)
		h_pct75                   Hourly 75th percentile wage
		h_pct90                   Hourly 90th percentile wage
		a_pct10                   Annual 10th percentile wage
		a_pct25                   Annual 25th percentile wage
		a_median                  Annual median wage (or the 50th percentile)
		a_pct75                   Annual 75th percentile wage
		a_pct90                   Annual 90th percentile wage
		annual                    Contains "TRUE" if only annual wages are released. The OEWS program releases only annual wages for some occupations that typically work fewer than 2,080 hours per year, but are paid on an annual basis, such as teachers, pilots, and athletes.
		hourly                    Contains "TRUE" if only hourly wages are released. The OEWS program releases only hourly wages for some occupations that typically work fewer than 2,080 hours per year and are paid on an hourly basis, such as actors, dancers, and musicians and singers.

	Notes:
	*  = indicates that a wage estimate is not available
	** = indicates that an employment estimate is not available
	#  = indicates a wage equal to or greater than $115.00 per hour or $239,200 per year
	~  = indicates that the percent of establishments reporting the occupation is less than 0.5%


4. General information:

	Information and definition of occupations: https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm
	
	

	The sum of the areas may differ from statewide employment for several reasons:

    - Rounding
    - The totals include data items that are not released separately due to confidentiality and quality reasons.
    - Many States include metropolitan areas that cross State lines. These cross-State metropolitan area estimates include data from each State,
	which should not be included in a total for a single State.
    - A small number of establishments indicate the State in which their employees are located, but do not indicate the specific metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area in which they are located. Data for these establishments are used in the calculation of the statewide estimates, but are not included in the estimates of any individual area.
